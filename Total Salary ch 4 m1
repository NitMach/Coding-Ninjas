Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -




import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Write your code here
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        int basic = s.nextInt();
        String grade = s.next();
        // System.out.println(grade.charAt(0));
        if(grade.charAt(0) == 'A'){
        	System.out.println(Math.round(basic + basic*0.2 + basic*0.5 + 1700 - basic*0.11));
        }else if(grade.charAt(0) == 'B'){
           System.out.println(Math.round(basic + basic*0.2 + basic*0.5 + 1500 - basic*0.11)); 
        }else{
            System.out.println(Math.round(basic + basic*0.2 + basic*0.5 + 1300 - basic*0.11));
        }
       
	}
}
